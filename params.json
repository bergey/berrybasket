Install [Adafruit Occidentalis](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro) 0.2 on Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n2. Plug RasPi into router, log into router to find IP address, ssh into RasPi\r\n\r\n3. Install python SPI library.  We learned to do this from [this blog post](http://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/2012/09/raspberry-pi-hardware-spi-analog-inputs.html)\r\n\r\n        git clone git://github.com/doceme/py-spidev\r\n        cd py-spidev\r\n        sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\n4. Download and install python packages for the Cosm API\r\n\r\n        git clone git://github.com/petervizi/python-eeml\r\n\r\n5. Download this script.\r\n\r\n        git clone git://github.com/bergey/berrybasket.git\r\n\r\n6. Sign up for Cosm account, create a new feed, fill out config file:\r\n\r\n    Fill in the blanks in config.json\r\n\r\n    - API_KEY\r\n\r\n    - API_URL appears in the URL of the feed webpage.  It's the number in http://cosm.com/feeds/84597\r\n\r\n# Hardware Setup\r\n\r\nWe're using the MCP3008 chip to convert analog measurements to digital.  The pins down one side of the chip are analog inputs; the other side connect to the computer.  The [aforementioned blog post](http://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/2012/09/raspberry-pi-hardware-spi-analog-inputs.html) has good pictures of which pins go to which Raspberry Pi connections.  The [Pi T-Cobbler breakout board](http://adafruit.com/products/1105) from [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com/) is a great help in connecting the Raspberry Pi to a breadboard.  Adafruit also sells the [MCP3008](http://adafruit.com/products/856).\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n- Allow measurement frequency to be specified in config file\r\n- Specify channels to log in config file\r\n- Add examples with specific sensors (thermistor, photoresistor)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
